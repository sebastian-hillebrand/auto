It does not reinvent the wheel. It just executes commands the way you would do it if you would have enough time to be a pro in every technology Auto covers.\r\n\r\nAnd last but not least. By default Auto tells you in front of every automation what it tries to reach for you, what it needs to do or change, and logs every step and its result in an easily understandable log file. Auto is designed this way because you should be able to understand and create or customize automation scripts for your needs.\r\n\r\nNo secrets. No obstacles. Just the way you want.\r\n\r\n# Why?\r\n\r\nBecause a lot of administrators, developers and users should spend their time in more meaningful things than solving the same problems over and over again.\r\n\r\n# Who?\r\n\r\n    Proojekte GmbH: Acting with insight and foresight.\r\n    Innovative services from highly motivated professionals.\r\n    \r\n    Phone: +49 2542 889147\r\n    Fax:   +49 2542 889148\r\n    \r\n          www.proojekte.de\r\n    kontakt(a)proojekte.de\r\n    \r\n    CEO:         Christian Wantia\r\n    Address:     Harwick 61, 48712 Gescher, Germany\r\n    Reg. court:  Amtsgericht Coesfeld\r\n    Reg. number: HRB 13094\r\n    VAT ID:      DE 275 978 266\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
