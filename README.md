# Introduction

## What?

Auto is a collection of scripts to automate as much as possible tasks by designing conventions and workflows for a better administrator, developer and user experience.

## Why?

Because [we](http://proojekte.de/) do not like needless manual work.

## How?

    Usage: auto <command> [<options>]

# Installation

There will be an PPA on Launchpad (https://launchpad.net/~proojekte/+archive/ubuntu/auto) if development has reached a point where our scripts are usable by common administrators.

At the moment you should not use these scripts if you have not been told to do so. They are in an very early stage of development.
