# What?

Auto is a well designed automation system. It simplifies commands and then automates workflows with easily understandable scripts.

# Why?

Because a lot of administrators, developers and users need to relax and want to spend their time in more meaningful things than solving the same problems over and over again.

# How?

    auto <command> [<source>] <target> [if <event>]
