# What?

Auto is a collection of scripts to automate as much as possible tasks by designing conventions and workflows for a better administrator, developer and user experience.

# Why?

Because [we](http://proojekte.de/) love technology that does everything the right way and helps us doing what we want. And because we do not like useless manual work.

# How?

Have a look at the corresponding [wiki](https://github.com/proojekte/auto/wiki).
