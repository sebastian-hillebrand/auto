Auto is an open and well designed automation system.

It simplifies commands and automates workflows using easily understandable scripts.

    Usage: auto <command> [<source>] <target> [if <event>]

Auto works as you expect it; even under the hood. It does not reinvent the wheel. It just executes commands the way you would do it if you would have enough time to be a pro in every technology Auto covers.

And last but not least. By default Auto tells you what it is doing; and what it has done. Because you should be able to understand what Auto does on you server or device and how to create or customize automation scripts for your needs.

No secrets. No obstacles. Just the way you want.

# Why?

Because a lot of administrators, developers and users should spend their time in more meaningful things than solving the same problems over and over again.
