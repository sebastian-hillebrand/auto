# Automation scripts for Ubuntu

We have designed some conventions that allow us to automate many tasks for administrators, developers and users. This collection of scripts is part of an concept for a better administrator, developer and user experience.

    Usage: auto <command> [<options>]

At the moment you should not use these scripts if you have not been told to do so. They are in an early stage of development.
